        <h1 class="text-center">WAYANAD </h1>
        <h6>Wayanad is a rural district in Kerala state, southwest India. In the east, the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary is a lush, forested region with areas of high altitude, home to animals including Asiatic elephants, tigers, leopards and egrets. In the Ambukuthi Hills to the south, Edakkal Caves contain ancient petroglyphs, some dating back to the Neolithic age</h6>

        <h3 class="text-center">Banasura Sagar Dam</h3>
        <h6>Another tourist attraction of Kalpetta is Banasura Sagar dam. It is the largest earth dam in India and the second largest of its kind in Asia. The dam is made up of massive stacks of stones and boulders.<br</h6>
         <h6>Banasura Sagar Dam consisting of a dam and a canal began operating as part of the Indian Banasura Sagar Project.  It aims at supporting the Kakkayam Hydro electric power project and also contributes to the irrigation and drinking water requirements of the people during summer, if there is water shortage.</h6>

         <h3 class="text-center">SOOCHIPIRA WATERFALLS</h3>
         <h6>Soochipara Falls (Sentinel Rock Waterfalls) is perhaps the most picturesque spot located in the periphery of Wayanad. It is a treat for eyes to see the milky white stream of water making its way to the rivers by passing through the rocky cliffs and clinging trees. The waterfall at the end joins Chaliyar River. Tourists will have to trek for around 30 minutes in downward inclination to reach the main pool, where exciting activities like swimming, bathing and other recreational activities take place now and then.

            While walking towards the main pool of the waterfall, visitors can see tea plantation, rocky edge and dense forest where the chances of spotting a tiger are quite bright. Many guesthouses and homestays are available on the waterfall stretch that offers the striking view of the mountains. Soochipara Falls is the latest fad for the adventures because it serves as an ideal base for trekking and rock climbing. Although flow is greatest during the summer season, the best time for sunset photography is arguably winter as the water flow is not that heavy. Don't forget to see the panoramic view of the mountains from the tree-top hut</h6>
