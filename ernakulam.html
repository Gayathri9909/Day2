        <h1 class="text-center">ERNAKULAM</h1>
        <h6>The district is endowed with a rich flora and fauna spread over the mainland and the hinterlands. Two backwaters and three major rivers have been instrumental in the agricultural, industrial and trade development of Ernakulam. Although the construction of huge overbridges such as the Goshree and Varapuzha in recent years have reduced the importance of water-transportation it is still a great attraction for the domestic and international tourists. Monsoon has not been unkind to Ernakulam District all these years. Mangrove forests here come to around 465 square KMs. The foothill areas such as Kodanad and Kothamangalam have a relatively stable eco-system. Besides paddy and coconuts, cash crops too are produced in the district. Ernakulam is the biggest pineapple producing district in Kerala. Two bird sanctuaries in the district, 
            Thattekkad and Mangalavanam, are shelter to the endangered species of birds and primordial spiders.</h6>

        <br>
       <h6>Puthuvype is a 3 kms long beach situated in Puthuvype near the lighthouse in Kochi, Kerala.
         One among the least explored beaches of Kochi, the highlight of the beach is also a lighthouse. Still unexploited by tourists, the beach is crowded by the fisherfolks at work. You can visit on a weekend for a perfect break from the city in peace and solitude.

         <br> 
         <h6>
            One of the first bird sanctuaries in Kerala and undeniably a haven for nature enthusiasts. In the words of Salim Ali (world famous ornithologist), Thattekkad is the “richest bird sanctuary in India” since it is home to hundreds of different endangered species of migratory birds. This thick deciduous forest has plantations of mahogany, teak, rosewood and rubber running through it. Make sure to bring along a pair of binoculars to get a glimpse of the birdlife. The best time to visit would be between November and March.
